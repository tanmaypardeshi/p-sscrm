## What P-SSCRM is

P-SSCRM (Proactive Secure Software Supply Chain Risk Management) is a framework
for managing software supply chain security risk. It organizes the work into
four **Groups** — Governance, Product, Environment, and Deployment — each broken
into **Practices** and then into concrete **Controls**. Every control states an
objective, a fuller definition, a set of self-assessment questions, and a
mapping to the established standards it draws from.

## The problem it solves

Teams trying to secure a software supply chain face a crowded field of
government and industry guidance — SSDF, SLSA, BSIMM, CNCF, OpenSSF, NIST
800-161, Executive Order 14028, and more — with overlapping vocabulary and no
single through-line. P-SSCRM was built to be that through-line: a single model
whose controls are cross-referenced to those sources, so a team can work from
one checklist and still show alignment with the standards that apply to them.

## How it was built

P-SSCRM was assembled by analyzing the contributing standards and frameworks
listed under [Standards & Frameworks]({{ "/frameworks/" | relative_url }}),
identifying the common practices across them, and expressing each as a control
with an explicit back-mapping. The framework definition and its mappings are
maintained in the open at
[github.com/p-sscrm/p-sscrm](https://github.com/p-sscrm/p-sscrm); the MITRE
ATT&CK technique mappings are maintained at
[github.com/p-sscrm/ats-to-ts](https://github.com/p-sscrm/ats-to-ts). This site
is generated from those repositories.

## Who it's for

- **Security leaders** planning or benchmarking a supply chain security program.
- **Engineers and practitioners** doing the work — start with
  [Which controls apply to me?]({{ "/roles/" | relative_url }}).
- **Assessors and consultants** evaluating a program against recognized practice.
- **Researchers and standards authors** looking for a consolidated view of the
  field.

## Citing P-SSCRM

P-SSCRM is described in the paper *P-SSCRM: Proactive Secure Software Supply
Chain Risk Management*, available at
[arxiv.org/abs/2404.12300](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12300). Please cite that
paper and link to this site.

## Who maintains it

P-SSCRM is stewarded by researchers at NC State University in collaboration with
the [Secure Software Supply Chain Center (S3C2)](https://s3c2.org/). For
questions or corrections, see [Contact]({{ "/contact/" | relative_url }}).
